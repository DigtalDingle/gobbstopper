# Concepts

High-level ideas and fundamentals to remember while learning.

---

### Control Structures
- Programs run top-to-bottom unless directed otherwise.
- `if / elif / else` allow branching logic.
- Loops (`for`, `while`) repeat actions until a condition changes.

### Data Structures
- Lists: ordered, index-based collections.
- Dictionaries: key/value pairs for fast lookup.
- Sets: unique, unordered collections.
- Tuples: immutable lists.

### APIs
- APIs expose data through endpoints.
- GET retrieves data.
- POST sends data.
- Responses must be checked for status and parsed safely.

### Git & GitHub
- Git tracks changes to code.
- Branches isolate work.
- Pull Requests combine changes cleanly.
- Merge conflicts happen when edits overlap.

These concepts support everything else you build in Gobbstopper.

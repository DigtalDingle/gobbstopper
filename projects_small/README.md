# Small Projects

A collection of simple, focused exercises that combine the basics I've learned.  
Each project is designed to be small enough to finish quickly but useful enough to reinforce real skills.

### Included
- `cli_tools/` — Command-line tools and utilities  
- `text_parsers/` — Small programs for reading and processing text

### Goal
Build confidence using fundamentals to create small, working programs.

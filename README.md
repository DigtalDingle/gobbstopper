# Gobbstopper

Gobbstopper is an endless-learning development project — a personal training ground built to sharpen my fundamentals, expand my skills, and guarantee that I always have something meaningful to work on.

This repository has no finish line. It evolves as I evolve.

## Purpose

Gobbstopper exists to:
- Master core developer fundamentals through continuous practice.
- Build technical depth in the areas every developer relies on.
- Explore new tools, APIs, frameworks, and concepts as I grow.
- Maintain a long-term space for self-improvement and experimentation.
- Give myself a permanent project I can return to anytime I want to develop, learn, or sharpen skills.

## What Gobbstopper Focuses On

### Core Skills
- **Control Structures:** loops, conditionals, flow control patterns.
- **Data Structures:** lists, dictionaries/maps, sets, tuples, transformations.
- **Git & Version Control:** commits, branching, conflicts, best practices.

### Intermediate Skills
- **APIs:** building, consuming, authentication, error handling.
- **OOP:** classes, objects, inheritance, abstraction.
- **Problem Solving:** logic, debugging, step-by-step reasoning.

### The Future
Gobbstopper will grow into:
- More advanced API projects
- Real tooling
- Mini frameworks
- Automation helpers
- Experiments with new languages, ideas, and architectures

Where it goes is up to how far I push myself.

# Gobbstopper

Gobbstopper is a never-ending development sandbox designed to sharpen core programming fundamentals.  
The goal is simple: always have something to learn, practice, or improve as a developer.

---

## Purpose
This project serves as a continuous training ground.  
Any time there's nothing else to do on GitHub, Gobbstopper provides new tasks, concepts, and experiments to work on.

## Structure
The project is organized into learning modules:

- **control_structures/**  
  Practice with loops, conditionals, and flow control.

- **data_structures/**  
  Lists, dictionaries, sets, and small data-processing exercises.

- **git_and_github/**  
  Version control fundamentals and safe merge-conflict practice.

- **api_basics/**  
  GET/POST requests, error handling, and small API mini-projects.

- **projects_small/**  
  Simple tools and text parsers combining multiple fundamentals.

- **notes/**  
  Concepts, snippets, and a running TODO list.

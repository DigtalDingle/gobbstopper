Merge Conflicts

This folder is a safe place to practice creating and resolving merge conflicts in Git.

What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict happens when two branches change the same part of a file and Git cannot automatically decide which version is correct.
To finish the merge, I have to open the file and choose what should stay.

What I will practice

Creating intentional conflicts

Identifying conflict markers in files

Editing the file to resolve the conflict

Completing the merge after the fix

Why this matters

Merge conflicts are a normal part of real development.
Being able to resolve them quickly and cleanly is a core skill every developer needs.

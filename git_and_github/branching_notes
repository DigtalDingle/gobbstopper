What I’ll practice

Creating new branches

Switching between branches

Making commits on separate branches

Merging branches back into the main branch

Seeing how changes differ between branches

Why this matters

Branches let me work safely without affecting my main code.
They are essential for:

Building new features

Fixing bugs

Experimenting

Keeping your project stable

Learning branching is a core skill for real-world development and team collaboration.

Branching Demo

This folder contains practice material for learning how Git branches work.

What I’ll practice

Creating new branches

Switching between branches

Making commits on separate branches

Merging branches back into the main line of development

Why it matters

Branches let me experiment, build features, or fix issues without touching your main code.
Mastering branching is one of the core skills of real-world development.

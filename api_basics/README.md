# API Basics

This folder contains examples and mini-projects for learning how to work with APIs.  
I'll practice sending requests, handling responses, managing errors, and understanding how services communicate.

### Included
- `simple_get_requests/` — Basic GET requests  
- `simple_post_requests/` — Basic POST requests  
- `error_handling/` — Handling failed requests  
- `mini_projects/` — Small API-driven programs

### Goal
Become comfortable interacting with external data and services.

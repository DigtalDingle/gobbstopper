API Basics

This folder contains practice material for working with APIs.
I will learn how to send requests, handle responses, and work with data from external services.

What I'll practice

Making simple GET requests

Making POST requests

Handling errors and bad responses

Reading JSON data

Building small API-powered scripts

Why this matters

APIs connect my code to the outside world.
Mastering them unlocks everything from automation to real-time data apps.

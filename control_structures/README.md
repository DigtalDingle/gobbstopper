Control Structures

This section contains practice files for mastering the most important flow-control tools in programming:

What you’ll learn

How if / elif / else logic works

How for loops iterate over sequences

How while loops repeat based on conditions

How to control flow with break, continue, and pass

How to combine control structures to build small programs

Goal

Build a foundation strong enough that flow control feels automatic and second nature in any language you learn.

Included

Simple examples (if_else_examples/)

Loop demos (loops_for/, loops_while/)

Small practice challenges (mini_projects/)
